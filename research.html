This was a project in algebraic combinatorics applied to string theory that I worked on during an 
eight-week summer exchange program with Prof. Amihay Hanany at Imperial College London during the summer 
after my junior year at MIT. The abstract is as follows: <br><br>

Superstring theory predicts a (9+1)-dimensional background spacetime and thus requires the orbifold
compactification of six spatial dimensions, achieved by taking the quotient by a finite isometry group.
Recent work in the context of quiver gauge theories has focused on enumeration of orbifolds of \(\mathbb{C}^n\)
by an Abelian group, which in general can be expressed as a product of finite cyclic groups. The toric diagrams of
these orbifolds are lattice simplices (generalized triangles) in \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). We review crystallographic methods 
for enumerating inequivalent orbifolds via such toric diagrams and for obtaining analytic expressions for the resulting 
sequences by means of multiplicative sequences and generating functions.  We then apply these methods to Abelian 
orbifolds of more general spaces with geometrically interesting toric diagrams, namely, the Platonic solids. 
Motivation for studying the Platonic solids comes from the study of quiver gauge theories; in the ADE classification 
of discrete subgroups of \(\text{SU}(2)\), the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids correspond to particularly simple quivers. <br><br>

Here is a <a href="https://mdecross.github.io/LatticePolytopesandOrbifolds.pdf">writeup</a> documenting my progress and 
results obtained during this project, and a <a href="https://mdecross.github.io/OrbifoldsTalk.pdf">slideshow</a>
summarizing these results more concisely.
