  <h1>Current Projects</h1>

  <h3>University of Pennsylvania</h3>

  <p>
  At Penn I am beginning research in AdS/CFT in the group of <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~vbalasub/public-html/Home.html">Prof. Vijay Balsubramanian</a>.
  The arcane acronym AdS/CFT stands for the <it>Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory</it> correspondence, in which certain quantities computed in a type
  of highly symmetric quantum field theory without gravity can equivalently be computed using string theory on a special kind of spacetime via a
  so-called "holographic dictionary". The initial concepts of holography stem from the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the entropy of a black hole, which states that the black hole entropy
  equals its horizon area (up to a constant) rather than its volume - so information inside a black hole is encoded on its surface like a hologram. 
  More recent generalizations, like the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, show that in AdS/CFT at weak gravitational coupling the areas of general surfaces in pure AdS
  (and therefore at least some of the gravitational physics) are determined by the pattern of entanglement entropy in the corresponding CFT. Thus, there is much 
  recent interest in formulating a complete description of gravity as an emergent phenomenon arising from the structure 
  of entanglement in some quantum field theory, extending these results to cosmological spacetimes like our universe, and exploiting
  parallels in the mathematical structure of the correspondence to make useful predictions about strongly coupled condensed matter systems.

  <h2>Previous Projects</h2>

  <h3>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h3>

<p>
While at MIT I did research in theoretical cosmology for several years in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/guth_alan.html">Prof. Alan Guth</a>'s
Density Perturbations Group, under the direction of <a href = "http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/">Prof. David Kaiser</a> and 
alongside Ani Prabhu, <a href = "https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/esfaki">Evangelos Sfakianakis</a>, and 
<a href = "http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/">Chanda Prescod-Weinstein</a>. A popular model of the early universe invented by Prof. Guth is that 
of <it>inflationary cosmology</it>, in which the universe expanded exponentially quickly during the first instants after the Big Bang. However,
this rapid expansion requires a large amount of energy, which must then be restored to matter fields to create particles so that the early
universe is hot and dense. The first stage of this <it>reheating</it> of the universe is known as <it>preheating</it>. 
</p><br>

<p>
We investigated a particular class of models of preheating in which multiple scalar fields coupled in a nonminimal way to the Ricci scalar. 
Such scalar fields are predicted by realistic models of high-energy physics in the early universe; the nonminimal couplings are the simplest
renormalizable (mathematically consistent) interactions of scalar fields with Einstein gravity. In our papers (below), we show that the field driving 
inflation (the <it>inflaton</it>) also drives resonant particle production in the other scalar fields. We identify different regimes of values of
certain parameters governing how strongly the fields couple, in which the dynamics of the resonances behave more or less strongly. Finally,
we show that the effects of the Hubble expansion of the universe during this phase are also distinct depending on the values of the couplings.

  <h3>Imperial College London</h3>

<p>
During the summer after my junior year at MIT I worked on a project in algebraic combinatorics applied to 
string theory during an eight-week summer exchange program with <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.hanany">Prof. Amihay Hanany</a> at Imperial College London.
The abstract is as follows: 
</p><br>

<p>
Superstring theory predicts a (9+1)-dimensional background spacetime and thus requires the orbifold
compactification of six spatial dimensions, achieved by taking the quotient by a finite isometry group.
Recent work in the context of quiver gauge theories has focused on enumeration of orbifolds of \(\mathbb{C}^n\)
by an Abelian group, which in general can be expressed as a product of finite cyclic groups. The toric diagrams of
these orbifolds are lattice simplices (generalized triangles) in \(\mathbb{R}^{n-1}\). We review crystallographic methods 
for enumerating inequivalent orbifolds via such toric diagrams and for obtaining analytic expressions for the resulting 
sequences by means of multiplicative sequences and generating functions.  We then apply these methods to Abelian 
orbifolds of more general spaces with geometrically interesting toric diagrams, namely, the Platonic solids. 
Motivation for studying the Platonic solids comes from the study of quiver gauge theories; in the ADE classification 
of discrete subgroups of \(\text{SU}(2)\), the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids correspond to particularly simple quivers.
